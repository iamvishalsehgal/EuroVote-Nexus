# SNA4DSProject
This is a project for Social Network Analysis course at JADS.  

This project is about analyzing social network within eurovision community. 
Data used for this project is taken from the eurovision website and can be accessed here: https://eurovisionworld.com/eurovision/2023

After collection and merging the dataset eventually consists of 3 csv files where 1 file describes nodes (countries) and the other 2 create edge lists. One edge list is created based on votes from jury and the other one is created based on votes from public. Due to time constraint for each voting only top 3 votes have been collected.  

Necessary packages to be installed:

install.packages("readxl") (necessary to read excel files, in case you you want to use csv file, use "readcsv" package)

tinytex::install_tinytex() (necessary to convert from rmd to pdf format)
