# SNA4DSProject
This is a project for Social Network Analysis course at JADS.  

This project is about analyzing social network within eurovision community. 
Data used for this project is taken from the eurovision website and can be accessed here: https://eurovisionworld.com/eurovision/2023

Please find here the executive summary of the report:

This study investigates community formation and voting patterns among Eurovision countries using 2023 public vote data. The research addresses two key inquiries: the extent of communities formed within the contest and the primary drivers behind public voting patterns. Analysis reveals a notable presence of small communities within the Eurovision context, underscoring the intricate social dynamics at play. Contrary to initial hypotheses, factors such as country government systems and language families do not significantly influence voting behavior. This suggests that while smaller communities prevail, traditional socio-political and linguistic ties have limited impact on public voting patterns. These findings prompt a reevaluation of the determinants driving voting behaviors in the Eurovision song contest, emphasizing the need for nuanced exploration of socio-cultural connections and emergent communities within the framework of this global musical event.

Within the Eurovision network there are 2 types of nodes. One type are the countries that distribute votes and other type are the countries that receive votes.
